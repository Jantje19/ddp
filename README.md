# DDP

This project is supposed to be a library version of the DDP features that [Meteor](https://meteor.com) offers.
This should allow for a more modular approach than using the whole Meteor framework. This library allows you to use the Meteor features without having to install the framework and without being tied into the NodeJS & NPM versions, build system, and other requirements.
